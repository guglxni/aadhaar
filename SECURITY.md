# Security Incident Report

## ðŸš¨ **SECURITY BREACH REMEDIATION - July 31, 2025**

### **Incident Summary**
**CRITICAL**: Private keys, certificates, and credentials were committed to git history.

### **Compromised Assets**
- **P12 Certificate**: `New_Public_AUA_for_Staging_Services_RootSigned_2428.p12`
- **Private Keys**: 7+ RSA private keys in `certs/` directory
- **Environment Files**: `sandbox.env` with license keys
- **UIDAI Certificates**: 19+ staging and production certificates
- **Vendor SDK**: UIDAI Java SDK with embedded configs

### **Remediation Actions Taken**
1. **âœ… Git History Purged**: Used `git-filter-repo` to remove all secrets from entire git history
2. **âœ… Repository Size**: Reduced from 400MB+ to 1.4MB
3. **âœ… Force-Push Completed**: Clean history deployed to GitHub (July 31, 2025)
4. **âœ… Security Guards**: Bulletproof `.gitignore` and pre-commit hooks implemented

### **ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE CREDENTIAL ROTATION REQUIRED**

**ALL CREDENTIALS MUST BE CONSIDERED COMPROMISED:**

| **Asset** | **Action Required** | **Priority** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| P12 Certificate | Contact UIDAI to revoke and reissue | **P0** |
| AUA License Keys | Regenerate via UIDAI portal | **P0** |
| ASA License Keys | Regenerate via UIDAI portal | **P0** |
| Private Keys | Generate fresh keypair on offline workstation | **P0** |
| GitHub Secrets | Rotate all CI/CD secrets | **P1** |

### **Team Action Items**
- **RE-CLONE REQUIRED**: All team members must delete local repos and clone fresh
- **Forks**: Any forks of this repository must be deleted and re-forked
- **Dependencies**: Purge old keys from CI systems, environment variables
- **Monitoring**: GitHub secret scanning enabled

### **Prevention Measures**
- Pre-commit hooks block secrets, build outputs, environment files
- `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of sensitive files
- Branch protection rules require code review
- Secret scanning alerts on future commits
